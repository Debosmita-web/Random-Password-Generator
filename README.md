Here,popular tkinter library is used for rendering graphics in our display window.

Project Prerequisites

To build this project I have used the basic concept of python and libraries â€“ Tkinter, pyperclip, random, string.

Tkinter is a standard GUI library and is one of the easiest ways to build a GUI application.

pyperclip module allows us to copy and paste text to and from the clipboard to your computer

The random module can generate random numbers

string module contains a number of functions to process the standard python string.

To install the libraries we can use pip installer from the command line:

pip install tkinter

pip install pyperclip

pip install random

pip install strings
